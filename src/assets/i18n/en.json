This term refers to a constant noise level that, over a specific period, would generate the same total sound energy as the actual varying noise levels. </p><br> <p> The terminology “LA” refers to the A-weighted sound pressure level. A-weighting in acoustics adjusts sound measurements to match human hearing sensitivity, giving more weight to mid-range frequencies and less to low and high frequencies. These adjusted levels noted as dB(A) or dBA, are used to better represent sound impact on people. </p><br> <p> The parameter <b>LAeq,t</b> is a type of average of the “Equivalent continuous sound level” over the sample period (t). It represents the sound level measured in a specific time interval. In the case of SoundCollect, the interval is 1 second. Therefore, LAeq,t shows the evolution of the recorded sound every second and the application records the sound for 30 seconds, a total of LAeq,t=30s values are obtained. </p><br> <p> From the LAeq value, the other acoustic parameters shown on the screen are calculated: </p><br> <ul> <li> <strong>LAmax</strong>: This is the maximum sound pressure level value recorded over 30 seconds. </li> <li> <strong>LAmin</strong>: This is the minimum sound pressure level value recorded over 30 seconds. </li> <li> <strong>L10</strong>: This is the sound pressure level exceeded 10% of the time. </li> <li> <strong>L90</strong>: This is the sound pressure level exceeded 90% of the time.</li> </ul><br> <p> For instance, if L90=60dB, it means that during 27 seconds (90%) of a 30-second recording, the sound pressure level was above 60dB. On the other hand, if L10=70dB, it indicates that during 3 seconds (10%) of the same 30-second recording, the sound pressure level exceeded 70dB.</p><br> "
